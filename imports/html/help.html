<h2 id="introduction">Help Guide Introduction</h2>
<p>In <strong>Flora by Tarot.io</strong>, you will help to raise Fey personifications of various Flora. This game is mechanically very minimal, with its most fun elements those of <strong>discovery</strong> and <strong>completion</strong>. If you are looking for a game with many gameplay mechanics you will not find it in <strong>Flora by Tarot.io</strong>!</p>
<p>The main gameplay loop of Flora by Tarot.io is → pick new Flora → return to the game over time multiple times to gain XP → level up the Flora → eventually complete the Flora’s growth stages → pick new Flora…</p>
<p>The design principles of <strong>Flora by Tarot.io</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No fail state</li>
<li>No punishment</li>
<li>Incremental progress over time</li>
<li>A focus on discovery and anticipation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flora by Tarot.io</strong> is a game to have patience with as you help Fey to grow, to return to periodically over time. This game is for busy people who want to smile. 1 XP is gained every 2 hours and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>All Fey are inspired by some plant, and share their namesake, but they may still look more unique when compared to the plant. These are playful nature spirits which live with and help these Flora.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-game">Starting the Game</h2>
<p>When you start Flora by Tarot.io, you are given the choice of selecting one of three starter Fey seedlings. Once you’ve picked a starter, you will still be able to pick the other two eventually so do not worry.</p>
<h2 id="fey-growth">Fey Growth</h2>
<p>All Fey of Flora grow in general patterns from Seed to Sprout to Flower to Fruit. Some Fey have more or less stages depending on what suits them. Growth stages are shown as a Level number. A Level 0 (zero) Fey is either a seed (ex: flowers) or a spore (ex: ferns). Most Fey have 3 levels, which translates to 0, 1, 2, 3 as different growth stages with 3 as the final.</p>
<p>Once you have helped a Fey to fully grow, it is added to your Garden. You can view unlocked Fey in your garden along with all of their growth stages and learn more more about them.</p>
<h2 id="ads-gold-cosmetics">Ads, Gold, Cosmetics</h2>
<p>Ads display at the bottom of the game. These banner ads are disabled by any In App Purchase made. You can also play the game with your device in airplane mode to not show any 3rd party ads. When no net connection is available, we will instead display 1st party promos for our own other games.</p>
<p>You may also choose to watch ads from the pause Menu. Watching these ads earns you gold, which you can then use to spend on extra cosmetics for your Fey such as new backgrounds or new growth vessels. If you do not wish to watch ads, you can permanently unlock various cosmetic sets via the <strong>Cash Shop</strong>. Even if you have unlocked a cosmetic with gold, you can always pay to unlock it permanently — such as if you reinstall the game fresh, or install on another device you own, these purchases will be able to be restored. All <strong>Cash Shop</strong> items are priced at $0.99 USD — you can press the buy button to see the price in your local currency. If you want to buy everything in the Cash Shop at once you can do so via the <strong>All-In-One</strong> option for $9.99 USD — no refunds are given if you buy a $0.99 USD priced item first so please buy carefully. The <strong>All-In-One</strong> option also includes any future Cash Shop item IAPs added to the game if they are ever added.</p>
<p>Before you watch an ad, you are shown the exact amount of gold you will earn from doing so. If you watch enough ads you will unlock bonus gold multipliers. Cosmetics unlocked via gold are not restored on reinstalling the game, they are only saved locally on your device.</p>
<h2 id="saved-games">Saved Games</h2>
<p>No game data is saved on a server. If you reinstall the game will you will have to begin your collection over again. Please backup your device to be able to keep your save data safe.</p>
<h2 id="completion-prestige">Completion, Prestige</h2>
<p>Once you have helped all Fey to grow, you will be given the option to Prestige in the game’s pause Menu. This will reset the progress of all of the Fey, and allow you to collect them again. Current Prestige level is shown on the pause menu as a number of stars.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>We may add more Fey over time. If you have completed your Fey collection, upon updating (assuming we add more Fey), you will be able to pick one of the new Fey added and continue growing. When Fey are added to the game as an update, they will be randomly available to pick from as you are given the option to pick.</p>
<h2 id="discord-chat-server">Discord Chat Server</h2>
<p>You can join the Discord server to talk with the developers and other fans like you. You can find a button to join via the pause Menu.</p>
